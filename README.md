#My first HTML project

<sub>This project is my first individual assignment where i'm working on html and jsp.
On this project, I learn how to properly design my form to make it more appeal to the user.I also learn how to add background image and how to style it appropriately whether to make it cover the whole screen or stretched it. Apart from that, I also learn how to add background music upon different input entered by the user by using if-else statement.</sub>
